		 *  The System.out stream, short for "Output", is used together with different methods
		 *  to output values or print text to the console.
			 *  print()  -> Prints text or values the console
			 *  printf() -> Prints formatted text or values to the console
			 *  println() -> Prints text or values to the console, followed by a new line

		/* The println() method prints text or values to the console, followed by a new line.

		 * easier to read.
